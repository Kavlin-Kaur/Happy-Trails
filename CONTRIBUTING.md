- 🤝 We're here to help - no question is too beginner-level!```bash```

```bash---git remote add upstream https://github.com/Kavlin-Kaur/Happy-Trails.git

pip install -r requirements.txt## Local Setup Guide```**12.** Make sure that you're on your main branch.

```### Step 1: Fork the Repository```

1. Go to [Happy-Trails Repository](https://github.com/Kavlin-Kaur/Happy-Trails)Verify your remotes:   git checkout main

This installs all the Python packages the project needs (Flask, SQLAlchemy, etc.)2. Click the **Fork** button (top-right corner)

3. Select where to fork (usually your personal account)```bash```

**Expected output:** Should show "Successfully installed..." messages4. You now have your own copy at `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Happy-Trails`

git remote -v

### Step 6: Configure Environment Variables**What just happened?** You created a copy of the project under your account that you can freely modify.

```**13.** Now that we have fetched the upstream repository, we want to merge its changes into our local branch. This will bring that branch into sync with the upstream, without losing our local changes.

Create a `.env` file in the project root (same folder as `app.py`):### Step 2: Clone Your Fork to Your Computer

```

```bash

# WindowsOpen your terminal/command prompt and run:

copy .env.example .env

You should see:   git merge upstream/main

# macOS/Linux

cp .env.example .env```bash

```

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Happy-Trails.git- `origin` → Your fork```

**If `.env.example` doesn't exist, create `.env` manually:**cd Happy-Trails

```- `upstream` → Original repository

Add these lines to `.env`:



```

FLASK_ENV=developmentReplace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

FLASK_DEBUG=True

SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key_12345
